# Media Queries Guide

Understanding breakpoints is crucial for creating responsive designs. Here's a guide on using media queries effectively:

## Breakpoints

Media queries allow you to apply specific styles based on the viewport size. Below is an example of a media query targeting viewports wider than 800px:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
  /* Insert your CSS properties here */
}
```

This media query will only trigger the defined CSS properties when the viewport width exceeds 800 pixels. Adjust the values to tailor your design for different screen sizes and resolutions.
